Under the mentorship of **Dr. Mostafa S. Ibrahim** (Senior Computer Vision Engineer at **NVIDIA, US**), I have built a solid foundation in:

- Python Programming & OOP  
- Data Structures and Algorithms  
- Libraries & Tools: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, Pyrorch, Opencv, YOLO 
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- Computer Vision  

This mentorship has been instrumental in enhancing my theoretical understanding and practical implementation skills.

### Currently Learning

- I'm continuing my learning journey in **Deep Learning**, focusing on both theoretical concepts and practical applications.  
- This is enriching my understanding of the **full ML lifecycle** — from data preprocessing and modeling to evaluation and deployment.
- I regularly apply this knowledge by solving algorithmic and data structure problems on [**LeetCode**](https://leetcode.com/u/Eng_Ahmed_Saleh/) and [**Codeforces**](https://codeforces.com/profile/AboSaleh)
